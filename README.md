## About Us
Our decision to focus on autism support is driven by a dual purpose. Firstly, we observed a significant void in India for a dedicated community and app for individuals with autism. This motivated us to create a platform addressing this critical need. Additionally, a team member with a younger brother who is autistic provides a personal connection and deep motivation. Through our efforts, we aim to contribute to a more supportive and inclusive environment for individuals with autism and their families.
